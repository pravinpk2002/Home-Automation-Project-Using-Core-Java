# Smart Home Automation System

## Overview
This project is a **Smart Home Automation System** developed in Core Java. It provides functionality to manage various appliances, gadgets, and electrical devices within a house. The system allows users to control devices remotely, monitor their status, and track their usage time. The application is designed to be flexible, supporting the addition of new devices and rooms in the future.

## Features
1. **Room Management**
   - The house can have multiple rooms, including:
     - Kitchen
     - Living Area
     - Dining Area
     - Bedroom
     - Washroom
     - Corridors

2. **Device Management**
   - Each room can have different gadgets or devices based on the room type:
     - Electronic devices
     - Lights
     - Air Conditioners
     - Television
     - Showers
   - Users can add gadgets/devices to specific rooms.

3. **Remote Control**
   - Users can turn on or off any device in any room remotely.

4. **Status Monitoring**
   - Check the status of each room and the devices in it (e.g., whether a device is ON or OFF).

5. **Usage Tracking**
   - Track the total time each device has been in its current state (ON/OFF).

6. **Future-Ready**
   - The application supports adding new devices or gadgets as they are identified in the future.

## How It Works
- **Adding Devices**: Users can dynamically add devices to specific rooms.
- **Controlling Devices**: Devices can be turned ON or OFF remotely using the application.
- **Monitoring Status**: Users can view the status of all devices in each room.
- **Tracking Usage Time**: The application calculates the total time each device has been in its current state.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Development Environment**: Eclipse IDE
- **Core Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
